# Coleman-Canoe-RAM-X15
Here you can find spare parts for a Coleman RAM X15 (Pelican) canoe. In the first project I redesigned a seat shell for building with a CNC mill or 3d printer.


First Project Chair:
A replacement seat shell for a Coleman Ram X15 canoe. I used DIN 7991 M6x50mm and hexagonal bolts to mount the seat. It is possible to print the shell in 3D or mill it out of wood.
